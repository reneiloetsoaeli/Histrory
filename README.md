IMAD Assignment report 

 

In this report, I will be going over the "History App” which I created. This app has many features ranging from the UI design to the internal Logic of the app, which are obviously known as the codes which were used to compile the main logic app. The app contains the different ages at which the ten different historical figures passed away.  

 

The user interface contains 3 components in which the user of the app can interact with. The first one being the space given to enter your age. The main function of this component is for the use to enter their age. The user can enter any age but the main requirement id to enter any age from twenty to one hundred. Another component of this user interface is the clear button. The clear button is there to instantaneously delete the age you have entered in case you entered is wrong or you have decided to try another age. Another button is the enter button and the main function is to generate a response to the age you have entered. Both these buttons are purple in colour and the enter button is slightly bigger in size. The user interface has another feature which cannot be inter- acted with. First, it has the text view header which highlight the name of the application which is "History app” and is display at the top-centre of the user interface at a size of about 40sp. At the bottom of the user interface, under the two buttons, is the text view which shows the result of the age you have entered. Words will only be seen in the text view once an age has been entered and the generate button has been pressed. The purpose of this particular text view is to generate or display a result of the unique age you have entered, whether it be an error text or an actual message of a historical figure. The size of this text View is around 25sp making it sizable for a response to the age which entered. The gravity of the text view result has been centred to make the app look more presentable and readable. Under the Text view Header is an image which represents History. The main function of the picture is to give app a bit more meaning and make it look more attractive to the user of the app. This small image helps the user understand the meaning of this app and co-responds with apps main function. 

 

The functionality of the "History app” is driven by the logic of the app which is compiled with ten codes of ten different historical figures all with different ages at which they passed away. These codes are made with "If statements” or in other word true or false logic. This true or false logic forms the backbone of the app's ability to calculate and display the age at which a historical figure died based on the user's input. By employing conditional logic, the app delivers accurate result providing the user with an educational experience. The ten different ages are 67, 39, 56, 78, 51, 36, 90, 50, 81 and 91. Once these ages are entered you will receive a message on the bottom of indicating the age and location of where the historical figure passed away. These Historical Figure's names are Leonardo da Vinci, Cleopatra, Abraham Lincon, Mahatma Gandhi, Napoleon Bonaparte, Marilyn Monroe, Winston Churchill, Michael Jackson, Queen Victoria and Pablo Picasso and these names are respective to the ages mentioned before. If a user enters an age outside the range of 20-100, the result with generate an error message saying, "The age you have entered is not within the required range” and when an age is entered, and it is within the range but there is no code for that certain age there will be a different error message which says "Please try another age”.

In conclusion, the "History App" represents a successful integration of user-friendly design and functional logic aimed at providing an educational and engaging experience for users. The app's user interface, with its clear and intuitive components, facilitates easy interaction. The inclusion of a space to enter age, a clear button for immediate corrections, and an enter button for generating results streamlines the user experience. The purple colour scheme adds a visually appealing touch, while the appropriately sized text views ensure readability and aesthetic balance. Furthermore, the app's internal logic, powered by if statements for ten different historical figures, demonstrates a structured and efficient approach to data handling. By incorporating a range of ages from twenty to one hundred, the app caters to a wide audience while maintaining accuracy in its calculations. The use of conditional logic ensures that the app provides relevant responses based on user input, whether it's displaying the age and location of a historical figure's passing or prompting error messages for out-of-range or unsupported ages.The educational value of the "History App" is noteworthy, as it not only provides information about historical figures and their lifespans but also encourages users to explore and learn about these personalities in a fun and interactive way. The inclusion of an image representing history adds a meaningful visual element, enhancing the app's thematic coherence and overall appeal.From a technical standpoint, the app's implementation of if statements reflects a solid understanding of programming logic and control flow. The logical structure ensures that the app functions smoothly, delivering accurate results and handling user inputs effectively. Additionally, the attention to detail in UI design, such as text view gravity settings and image placement, contributes to a polished and professional look.Overall, the "History App" stands as a testament to effective mobile application development, combining thoughtful design choices with robust logic to create a valuable tool for historical education and exploration. With its user-friendly interface and informative content, the app has the potential to engage users of all ages and foster a deeper appreciation for history and its significant historical figure thank you
